This is a assignment I had to do. I had to create a server, run it, make different routes and send diff HTML pages on those routes . I also had to make a input in one of those routes and had to take a POST data which is : writing a user name and sending it, then when i got that data i had to parse it and make a file with it...that file was user.txt. this is the raw way to do node.js without express and he was showing it this way so that we can see what happens behind the scenes.
